### Installation  
> 1. create virtual python environment
> 1. `pip install Django`
> 1. `pip install channels`
>       - If working on windows, before installing channels download twisted from  
        https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/  
        and use pip install Twisted‑20.3.0‑cp39‑cp39‑win_amd64.whl  
        (Twisted gave me trouble when working in windows, this version is pre-compiled)
